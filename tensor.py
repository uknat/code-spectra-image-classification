# This is to provide a simplified example that touches on each of the key phases: data collection and 
# preparation, exploratory data analysis, model selection and architecture, model training, evaluation, 
# testing, and a brief overview of deployment considerations. This example will use the CIFAR-10 dataset, 
# a classic dataset for image classification tasks, which is conveniently accessible via TensorFlow's 
# Keras API.

# Step 1: Setup and Data Collection
# First, let's import the necessary libraries and load our dataset.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Let's visualize some images from the dataset.

class_names = ['airplane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

# Plot the first 25 images from the training set and display the class name below each image
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    # The CIFAR labels happen to be arrays, 
    # which is why you need the extra index
    plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i][0]])
plt.show()

# Step 3: Model Selection and Architecture
# Here, we'll define a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) suitable for image classification.

model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10))

# Step 4: Model Training
# Now, compile and train the model.

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, 
                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

# Step 5: Model Evaluation
# Evaluate the model on the test dataset.

test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images,  test_labels, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)

# Step 6: Model Testing
# Here, you can make predictions with the model on new data.

predictions = model.predict(test_images)

# Step 7: Deployment
# For deployment, you'd typically convert your model to a format suitable for your target environment, such as TensorFlow Lite for mobile or TensorFlow Serving for server-based environments. Here's a quick overview of saving the model.

model.save('my_model.h5')  # Save the model

# For TensorFlow Serving
tf.saved_model.save(model, "my_model_serving")

# Deployment specifics, such as setting up a web service or integrating the model into an application, 
# would depend on your particular use case and environment.

# This example provides a foundational approach to developing an image classification project with 
# TensorFlow. For real-world projects, you would need to expand upon each step, including more 
# comprehensive data preprocessing, EDA, model tuning, and deployment strategies.
